                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a full-stack developer. a focus on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express, Handlebars, JQuery,Squelize,React and MySQL. I received my certification from the University of Minnesota on May 2018, I am currently
                        open to full-time positions in the Minneapolis/St Paul area. as well as other major metropolitan areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns from Biology, to full Stack Web Deverloper. I've never stopped engaging my passion to help
                        others and solve problems.</p>
                    <p>I chose a coding "bootcamp" because I started my career in Biology degree. I graduated in 2016 from
                        <i>The</i> University Of Minnesota with a Bachelor's degree in Biological Environmental Science. Like many Biologist fresh out of college, I started my career as an working in the Hospital field and lab tech. After a while
                        i figure out that this is not the right field i should be, and i swich gears, went to University of St Thomas for master in Software Engineering, which i am currently on 1st year.
                    </p>
                    <p>After a few months, I realized that I wanted to push myself more. I was working freelance interpreter, after i left my other job. i notice that the difference being a web developer and my freelance job, coding was my hobby i always
                        love to do, and I soon realized that I could combine my experiences into a career that I love.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth
                        company.
                    </p>
                    <p>I left my career in freelance to spend three months emersing myself into a new world. What you will see within this website is a culmination of the skills I have acquired over the course of the full-stack program. If you have any questions
                        about what you have seen on this website, please send me an
